TODOS:
1. On all pages, get rid of the Error: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
2. In global.R, in plotmap, remove the "variable" with an appropriate label.
   Previously, it was variable (without quotes) but it was giving an error.
3. On the "Daily temperature overview" tab, the "Starting Point" year is having no effect.
   That's because the 'start' argument isn't being used.
4. Make the play button work on "Daily temperature overview" tab.
